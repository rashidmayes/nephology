text.about=About
text.about.desc=The core platform is Java with the Aerospike NoSQL database, both deployed on Linux. The Java application uses the cloud provider's API to spin up instances from an image which contains the tools for inspecting and benchmarking the environment. On startup, the instances execute the tools, report the results, which are stored in Aerospike, and shutdown.
